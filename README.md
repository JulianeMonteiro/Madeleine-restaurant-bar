  # How did the idea come about?
  
This page was developed using HTML and CSS.

The choice of the theme of the page was made to put into practice my knowledge in:

- Positioning of elements using the 'Display Grid' property
- 'Overlay' effect on product images
- 'Hover' effect on the button
- Make the page responsive using 'Media Queries'
